I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/) from University of Birminghan and [Prof. Ke Tang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/) from Southern University of Science and Technology. In addition, I obtained my bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC in June 2014.

**Research Interests**: Hyper-parameter Optimization, Automatic Algorithm Design, Combinatorial Optimization.
