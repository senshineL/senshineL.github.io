I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/) from University of Birminghan and [Prof. Ke Tang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/) from Southern University of Science and Technology. In addition, I obtained my bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC in June 2014.

## Softwares

* [VRPenstein](https://github.com/senshineL/VRPenstein): A highly-flexible and high-performance meta-heuristic with considerable large configuration space for the vehicle routing problems (VRP).

* GA-EAX-restart: A restart version of the powerful Genetic Algorithm with Edge Assembly Crossover (GA-EAX by Nagata & Kobayashi). In our massive experiments, GA-EAX-restart could consistantly outperform GA-EAX and LKH 2.0.9, the two state-of-the-art inexact solvers for TSP.

* CNN-TSP: End-to-end algorithm selection system for the EUC-2D TSP.
