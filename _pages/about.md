I am currently a research assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).

Before joining SUSTech, I obtinaed my PH.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/) from University of Birminghan and [Prof. Ke Tang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/) from University of Science and Technology of China. In addition, I obtained my bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC in June 2014.

## Research Interests
* Intersection between Parallel Algorithms Portfolios and Evolutionary Computation
* Efficient Algorithms for Black-box Combinatorial Optimization Problems 
* Automated Algorithm Configuration and Its Applications
