# Be a good programmer

Here is a list of some staff which is most helpful for me to improve my programming skills.

* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - Proficiency with neccessary tools. E.g., the command-line, text editor and version control systems.

* Computer System: A Programmer's Perspective [[PDF](http://senshineL.github.io/files/CSAPP_ed3.pdf), [CMU Course](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)] - Establishing a systematic view of computer systems.

* [How to Write Fast Code](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pueschel/teaching/18-645-CMU-spring08/course.html) - Writting fast code is much harder than writting correct code.

* Mathmatics for Computer Science [[PDF](http://senshineL.github.io/files/mcs.pdf), [MIT Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/)] - Elementary discrete mathematics for computer science and engineering.
